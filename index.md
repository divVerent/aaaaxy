AAAAXY is a nonlinear 2D puzzle platformer taking place in impossible
spaces.

Although your general goal is reaching the surprising end of the game,
you are encouraged to set your own goals while playing. Exploration will
be rewarded, and secrets await you!

So jump and run around, and enjoy losing your sense of orientation in
this World of Wicked Weirdness. Find out what Van Vlijmen will make you
do. Pick a path, get inside a Klein Bottle, recognize some memes, and by
all means: don't look up.

And beware of a minor amount of trolling.

To reach the end, a new player will take about 4 to 6 hours, a full
playthrough can be finished in about 1 hour and the end can be reached
in about 15 minutes.

The game is available for the following platforms:
